# Goblin-Game

This game was inspired by the movie Spider-Man: No Way Home. The Green Goblin tries to collect as many gold coins in the city of New York to be able to combat Spider-Man. 

The user clicks its mouse onto the screen to make the Green Goblin fly over the New York towers. The goal is to collect as many coins as possible before obtaining the final royal coin at the end mark.
